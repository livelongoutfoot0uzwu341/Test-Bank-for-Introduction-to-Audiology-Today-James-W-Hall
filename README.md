  * An up-to-date introduction to the profession of audiology, Introduction to Audiology Today is written to stimulate the student’s interest and excitement in audiology or speech-language pathology as a career choice. Chapters on hearing science covering essential information about sound and auditory anatomy/physiology include helpful figures and readable explanations of recent research findings. Current behavioral and objective procedures and strategies for hearing assessment of children and adults are described and consistently related to clinical audiology practice. Two chapters are devoted to a readable and up-to-date review of the diverse etiologies underlying peripheral and central auditory dysfunction, including auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder and auditory processing disorders. The text is enhanced with an assortment of high quality digital photographs illustrating the tools and technologies used by audiologists in clinical practice.
